 - Shooting: The player can shoot bullets, but only one at a time. Once the bullet hits an enemy or moves off-screen, you can shoot again.
 - Enemies: A group of enemies moves from side to side, descending slowly. If any enemy touches your spaceship, it's game over.
 - Enemy Speed: Enemies move faster as they descend, adding more challenge as the game progresses.
